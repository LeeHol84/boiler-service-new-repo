                            <p><br>2.3 We will make every effort to arrive and to complete the work on time. However, we will not be liable or responsible for any delay or failure to carry out the work, due to an event outside our control such as poor traffic conditions, poor weather conditions or the failure of public or private telecommunications networks. If such an event happens, we will let you know as soon as possible and you can cancel the job if you no longer want us to carry out the work. We may cancel the job if the event lasts for more than 4 weeks.</p>
                       
                            <p><br>2.4 To enable us to carry out the work you will need to:</p>

                            <p><br>(b) ensure that the premises are clear and safe for us to access and that you own the premises and do not need the consent of another person to enable us to carry out the work.</p>
                       
                            <p><br>(c) ensure that any materials you provide to enable us to carry out the work are suitable. If you fail to do so, we may not be able to carry out the work and you may need to contact us to arrange a further visit.</p>
                       
                            <p><br>2.5 When our engineer has completed the job, he will complete a Job Sheet. This will include the time he arrived at the premises, the work carried out, the time that the work was completed and the price to be paid by you. You will be asked to sign the Job Sheet to confirm that this information is correct. If you think that any of the information listed on the Job Sheet is inaccurate, please telephone us on 0161 549 1009 or write to us at Hadfield House, Gordon St, Stockport SK4 1RR or email office@localplumberswecare.co.uk. We shall assign a Job Number to the job which will be written on the Job Sheet. Please quote the Job Number in all subsequent correspondence with us relating to the job.</p>
                       
                            <strong><p>3. PRICE AND PAYMENT</p></strong>

                            <p><br>3.1.1 For jobs booked on an hourly or half-hourly rate, labour will be charged from the moment that our engineer arrives at your premises at the hourly or half-hourly rate quoted and specified on the Job Sheet. For example, if our engineer is at your premises for 45 minutes, we will charge for one hour and we will charge you £125 for the work. Please note that all jobs are a minimum of an hour, we will charge for any time spent by our engineer diagnosing the work to be carried out.</p>
                       
                            <p><br>3.1.2 For jobs booked on a fixed price, you will be charged from the moment that our engineer arrives at your premises at the fixed price quoted and specified on the Job Sheet. For example, if we have told you that you will charge you a fixed price of £110 for the labour, we will charge you £110 for the labour, plus the cost of any parts that may be required. Some fixed price jobs also include the cost for parts, which we will confirm when you book the job.<br><br></p>

In such cases we will advise you that this is only a temporary repair, and we will advise you on any further work, parts and materials that will need to be done to provide a more permanent solution. It will be noted on the Job Sheet that this is just a temporary repair, and the work is not guaranteed. In such cases we will charge you for any labour, parts and materials used in remedying the defect.</p>
                       
                            <p><br>5.5 This guarantee is in addition to and does not affect your legal rights in relation to any goods that are faulty or not as described.</p>
